### 87/100. Very nice work. Please find the comments below for details.
### Scores on each part
#### 1. Introduction and data description 
##### 4/5 Nice introduction and very interesting topic. Data description could be made better by summarizing some key features of the data at the beginning. 
#### 2. Formulation of research question
##### 5/5 Very clear formulation of the objectives. 
#### 3. Data acquisition
##### 9/10 By importing a `csv` file and using Twitter API. 
#### 4. Data cleaning and reshaping
##### 25.5/30 This section is well-organized, but would be better by adding more explanatory text and shortening some lengthy output. 
#### 5. Visualization
##### 28/30 Includes several interactive map plots, line plots, boxplots, would clouds. Most of the figures are adjusted to be very nice-looking. But would be better to add more discussions for some of these figures/plots. 
#### 6. Data modelling
##### 8/10 Use of random forest for classification and calculating the variable importance score. Visualization is used to better explain the results. Would be better to include the ROC curve as well. 
#### 7. Conclusion and the overall structure 
##### 7.5/10 The conclusion is good by summarizing some of the key findings. The overall structure would be made better by including more explanatory text and more detailed discussions about the results/plots/figures. A very nice work overall!
