### 89/100. Thanks for the hard work! Please find the comments below for details.
### Scores on each part
#### 1. Introduction and data description 
##### 4/5 Nice introduction and very interesting topic. Would be better to briefly talk about the data at the beginning. 
#### 2. Formulation of research question
##### 4.5/5 Interesting research question formulated at the beginning. 
#### 3. Data acquisition
##### 10/10 By importing a `csv` file, web scraping and the use of API, demonstrating strong abilities in data acquisition. 
#### 4. Data cleaning and reshaping
##### 29/30 A lot of work have been done here. The data section is a bit lengthy and unorganized. Would be better to split this section into two separate sections, on data acquisition and data cleaning. 
#### 5. Visualization
##### 26/30 Data visualization includes a world map, several boxplots, line plots, word clouds, a plot of network, etc. The twitter location plot and the Venn diagram are nice looking. The line plot and box plot at code cell [95] could be made better. 
#### 6. Data modelling
##### 7.5/10 Includes use of classification. ROC curve is plotted to illustrate the results. Would be better to compare the performance of several different classifiers. 
#### 7. Conclusion and the overall structure 
##### 8/10 The conclusion is good by summarizing some of the key findings and discussing future directions. The overall structure would be made better as discussed in 4.
